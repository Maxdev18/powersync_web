# PowerSync Web Application
PowerSync is a fictitious company that sells its own manufactured electronic IoT products that have a built-in wifi capability. The goal of PowerSync is to allow people to manage and track battery status and power consuption across all thier PowerSync devices.

This repository consists the codebase for the PowerSync Web Application. This application weighs more towards the implementation and design of web services and microservices. With the integration of NodeJS as the backend server of choice, this ensures the support of header configuration and reliablity of these services. 

This is a public repository and may be forked by anyone who may want to play around and test the application.

### Setup
To start, open your terminal and navigate to a directory of your choosing. Then run the clone command `git clone https://github.com/Maxdev18/powersync_web.git` to get a copy of the repository. After doing so, navigate to the powersync_web root directory, `cd powersync_web`.

### Install dependencies
After cloning, you need to install all the necessary dependecies. We are utilizing npm packages so run the command `npm i`. After successful installation, you can now move on to starting the application.

### Starting the server
To start the server, simply run `npm start`. You should see a message in the terminal saying that the server is running on port 8080. You can then open your browser of your choice and enter in localhost:8080 into the url bar and should see the application running.
